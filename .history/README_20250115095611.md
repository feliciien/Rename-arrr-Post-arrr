# RenameArrr

A powerful media file renaming tool with metadata fetching and organization features.

## Overview

RenameArrr allows users to easily rename and organize media files such as movies, TV shows, music, and anime by fetching metadata from online databases.

## Building the Windows Installer

To create a Windows installer for RenameArrr, follow these steps on a **Windows machine**:

### Prerequisites

- **Windows Operating System**
- **Python 3.8 or higher** installed from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Git** installed from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **PyInstaller** installed via `pip install pyinstaller`
- **Inno Setup** installed from [jrsoftware.org](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open Command Prompt and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/feliciien/Rename-arrr-Post-arrr.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd Rename-arrr-Post-arrr
   ```

3. **Install Required Python Packages**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install PyInstaller**

   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

5. **Build the Executable**

   Run the build script to generate the executable:

   ```bash
   python build_windows_installer.py
   ```

   This will create `RenameArrr.exe` in the `dist` folder located at `Rename-arrr-Post-arrr\dist\RenameArrr.exe`.

6. **Prepare Inno Setup Script**

   Ensure `installer.iss` is in the project root directory (`Rename-arrr-Post-arrr\installer.iss`).

7. **Create the Installer with Inno Setup**

   - Open **Inno Setup**.
   - Click **File** > **Open** and select `installer.iss`.
   - Click **Build** > **Compile**.
   - The installer `RenameArrrInstaller.exe` will be generated in the `dist` folder at `Rename-arrr-Post-arrr\dist\RenameArrrInstaller.exe`.
