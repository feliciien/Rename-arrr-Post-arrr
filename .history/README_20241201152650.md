# Rename-arrr

Rename-arrr is a versatile file renaming tool designed for media enthusiasts and content organizers. It allows seamless renaming of media files such as movies and TV shows by fetching metadata from APIs like [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/). The tool supports both a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command-Line Interface (CLI), ensuring accessibility and automation for all users.

## **Features**

### **Core Functionalities**
- Rename media files based on metadata (title, release year) fetched from TMDb.
- Fallback mechanism to extract title and year directly from filenames if metadata is unavailable.
- Prevents duplicate filenames by appending numeric suffixes (`[1]`, `[2]`, etc.).
- Supports a wide range of file extensions: `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.mov`, etc.

### **User Interfaces**
- **GUI:**
  - User-friendly interface built with PyQt5.
  - Progress bar to display renaming progress in real-time.
  - Browse and select folders for batch renaming.
- **CLI:**
  - Simple and powerful command-line interface for automation.
  - Supports folder input and real-time logging.

### **Logging and Error Handling**
- Comprehensive logging to track activities and errors.
- Graceful fallback to filename-based renaming for files without metadata.
